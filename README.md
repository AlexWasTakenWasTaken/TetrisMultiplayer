# Tetris Battles

Tetris Battles is a visually appealing and interactive implementation of the classic Tetris game, designed to showcase advanced Java programming skills. This project highlights creativity and technical expertise by combining object-oriented programming, graphics rendering, and game mechanics.

## Features
- **Single Player Mode**: Play the classic Tetris game with increasing levels of difficulty.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Engage in competitive play with a second player on the same screen.
- **Custom Difficulty Levels**: Choose from multiple levels of difficulty, ranging from Easy to Extreme.
- **Dynamic Graphics**: Real-time rendering of the game board, pieces, and interface using Java's `Graphics` API.
- **Custom Color Palette**: Unique color schemes for pieces and board elements, enhancing visual appeal.
- **Interactive Menu**: Navigate through a responsive graphical user interface to set up the game.
- **Sound Effects and Background Music**: Adds an immersive auditory experience.

## Skills and Technologies
### Programming Concepts
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
  - Encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance used extensively in classes like `Board`, `Pieces`, and `Tetris`.
  - Modular design, dividing functionality into multiple cohesive classes for better maintainability.
- **Algorithm Design**:
  - Collision detection for piece movement and rotation.
  - Scoring and row-clearing logic.
  - Randomized piece generation.

### Graphics and Interface Design
- **Java Swing**:
  - Implementation of interactive graphical components, such as menus, buttons, and game displays.
- **Custom Graphics Rendering**:
  - Dynamic drawing of Tetris pieces and board using Java's `Graphics` class.
  - Smooth animations for piece movement and board updates.

### File and Resource Management
- **Audio Management**:
  - Loading and playing sound effects and background music using the Java Sound API.
- **Resource Handling**:
  - Efficient handling of images and audio files for game assets, ensuring seamless integration.

### Problem-Solving and Debugging
- Development of an intuitive input-handling system for single and multiplayer controls.
- Optimization of game logic to ensure smooth gameplay and responsiveness.

### Creativity and Design
- Custom Tetris pieces and difficulty levels, offering unique gameplay experiences.
- Aesthetic menu design with a focus on usability and engagement.

## Highlights
- This project demonstrates the integration of technical skills with creativity to deliver a polished and enjoyable gaming experience.
- It reflects the ability to handle complex logic, graphical rendering, and user interaction in a single application.
